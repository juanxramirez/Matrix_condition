# Overview
The Matrix_condition repository includes `R` code, `Python` code, and data to reproduce the analyses shown in the article:

**Matrix condition mediates the effects of habitat fragmentation on species extinction risk**

_by J.P. Ram√≠rez-Delgado, M. Di Marco, J.E.M. Watson, C.J. Johnson, C. Rondinini, X. Corredor Llano, M. Arias, and O. Venter_

In this article, we quantify the relationship between changes in the extinction risk of 4,426 terrestrial mammals over a 24-year period (1996-2020), the fragmentation of their suitable habitat (in terms of the degree of fragmentation and the degree of patch isolation), and the levels of human pressure within the associated habitat matrix (i.e. the  condition of the matrix). In Fig. 1, we show how we classified extinction risk transitions based on past and present IUCN Red List categories. In Fig. 2, we show the relative importance of selected variables for the prediction of extinction risk transitions in terrestrial mammals. In Fig. 3, we show the effect of the degree of fragmentaiton, the degree of patch isolation, and the matrix condition on extinction risk transitions in terrestrial mammals. Finally, we show the influence of low-quality matrices and high-quality matrices on the relative importance of selected predictors of extinction risk transitions in terrestrial mammals (Fig. 4).

Each script loads necessary packages and sets up path and working directories. This set up needs to be adjusted for specific users and `R` or `Python` sessions. 

Scripts from 1 to 7 can be used to reproduce the figures shown in the main manuscript. 
Other scripts can be used to reproduce the figures shown in the supplementary information of the article.

Input data are available within each folder of this repository, with the exception of the habitat suitability models, which were derived from another study and are available only upon request (see https://globalmammal.org/habitat-suitability-models-for-terrestrial-mammals/).

# System requirements
