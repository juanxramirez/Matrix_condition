**The matrix condition mitigates the effects of fragmentation on species extinction risk**

_by Juan Pablo Ram√≠rez-Delgado, Moreno Di Marco, James E. M. Watson, Chris J. Johnson, Carlo Rondinini, Xavier Corredor Llano, Miguel Arias, and Oscar Venter_

In this article, we quantify the relationship between changes in the extinction risk of 4,426 terrestrial mammals over a 24-year period (1996-2020), the fragmentation of their suitable habitat (in terms of the degree of fragmentation and the degree of patch isolation), and the levels of human pressure within the associated habitat matrix (i.e. the  condition of the matrix). In Fig. 1, we show how we classified extinction risk transitions based on past and present IUCN Red List categories. In Fig. 2, we show the relative importance of selected variables for the prediction of extinction risk transitions in terrestrial mammals. In Fig. 3, we show the effect of the degree of fragmentaiton, the degree of patch isolation, and the matrix condition on extinction risk transitions in terrestrial mammals. Finally, we show the influence of low-quality matrices and high-quality matrices on the relative importance of selected predictors of extinction risk transitions in terrestrial mammals (Fig. 4).

Each script loads necessary packages and sets up path and working directories. This set up needs to be adjusted for specific users and R/Python sessions. 

Scripts from 1 to 7 can be used to reproduce the figures shown in the main manuscript. 
Other scripts can be used to reproduce the figures shown in the supplementary information the article.

Input data are available within each folder of this repository, with the exception of the habitat suitability models, which were derived from another study and are available only upon request (see https://globalmammal.org/habitat-suitability-models-for-terrestrial-mammals/).

# System requirements 

## Hardware requirements 
The code presented here requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations.

## Software requirements
To run R scripts (.R), users should have `R` version 4.1.0 or higher.

To run Python scripts, userd should have `Python` version 3.7.10 or higher. 

# 1. Historical_assessments_Red_List_IUCN_categories.R
Creates a table with the IUCN Red List categories over time. Requires `list_of_species_with_habitat_suitabilty_defined.txt` as input data.

# 2. Retrospective_adjustments_and_genuine_changes.py
Creates a table showing IUCN Red List categories over time based on retrospective adjustments and genuine changes. Requires `historical_assessments.xlsx` (output from `1. Historical_assessments_Red_List_IUCN_categories.R`) and `list_sp_with_genuine_changes.xlsx` as input data.

# 3. Classifying_extinction_risk_transitions.py
Creates a table with the transitions of exitnciton risk for each species based on retrospective adjustments and genuine changes in the IUCN Red List categories over time. Requires `transposed_and_filtered_with_genuine_changes.xlsx` (output from `2. Transpose_and_filter_historical_assessments_with_genuine_changes.py`) as input data. Note: The number of species facing a low-risk transition and those facing a high-risk transition were obtained from here, which was included in the Fig. 1 of the article.

# 4. High_HFP_extent_suitable_unsuitable.py
Runs the spatial analyses for the quantification of the degree of fragmentation, the degree of patch isolation, the extent of high human footprint values within the matrix, the extent of high human footprint values within suitable habitat, the change in the extent of high human footprint values within the matrix, the change in the extent of high human footprint values within suitable habitat, and the proportion of suitable habitat when the extent of suitable habitat is represented by high and medium habitat suitability combined, and the extent of the matrix by unsuitable habitat alone. Requieres habitat suitabilty models (available only upon request; https://globalmammal.org/habitat-suitability-models-for-terrestrial-mammals/), `hfp2000_merisINT_3_or_above.tif`, `hfp2013_merisINT_3_or_above.tif`, and `WorldMollweide.prj` as input data. 

# 5. RF_high_medium_first_last.R
Runs a random forest model for the prediction of extinction risk transtions in terrestrial mammals when the extent of suitable habitat is represented by high and medium habitat suitability combined, and the extent of the matrix by unsuitable habitat alone. Here, we show the relative variable importance of predictors (Fig. 2), as well as the effect of the degree of habitat fragmentation, the degree of patch isolation, and the matrix condition on the probability of extinction risk transitions in terrestrial mammals (Fig. 3). Requires `data_high_medium_first_last.txt` as input data. Line can take anywhere from 3 to 5 hours to finish, depending on the speed of the processor.

# 6. RF_quality_matrix.R
Runs random forest models to predict extinction risk transitions for both species with a low-quality matrix and species with a high-quality matrix. Here, we show the relative variable importance in predicting extinction risk transitions for species with a low-quility matrix (Fig. 4a) and for species with a high-quality matrix (Fig. 4b). Requires `data_high_medium_first_last.txt` as input data. 

# 7. Wilcox_test_and_cohens_d_quality_matrix.R
Runs the Wilcoxon rank sum tests used to test for statistical differences in the degree of fragmentation and the degree of patch isolation between low-risk and high-risk species with a low-quality matrix and a high-quality matrix. It also calculates effect sizes (based on Cohen's d statistic) to determine the effect size of the degree of fragmentation and the degree of patch isolation between low-risk and high-risk species with a low-quality matrix and a high-quality matrix (Supplementary Fig. 5). Requires `data_high_medium_first_last.txt' as input data.

# Extract_IUCN_categories.py

# Transition_matrix_of_extinction_risk_categories.R

# High_HFP_extent_medium_unsuitable_combined.py
